# What is this
just a personal didactic exercise, i wanted to make a json parser on my own.

# Should I use it?
Absolutly no, this is just an exercise, this library lacks of error handling,
well, there is, but I'm not sure that works 100% of the times. Beside that,
this library doesen't cover all possible json encoded objects, in fact there
is no support for exponential notation or negative numbers.
